# ng2-movie-queue
My goal was to create a manageable queue of movies I want to watch, sort of like a simple to-do list for movies. I didn't get very far since this is my first time using both Angular 2 and TypeScript, the thing I got stuck on was setting up a form (Couldn't initialize a new ControlGroup, I eventually gave up on using a form), and getting an input to bind one-way to the controller. Eventually I discovered the documentation's to-do example and this is basically that + local storage and removal.
